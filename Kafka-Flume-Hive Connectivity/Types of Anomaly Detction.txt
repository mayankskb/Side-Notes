1.Supervised Anomaly Detection.
A group of patterns are labelled as anomalies and we need to
find them. This is just a classification problem where one of
the classes is named ”anomaly”.

2. Static Unsupervised Anomaly Detection.
There are a number of labelled pattern classes and suddenly
a weird unrecognized outlier pattern shape shows up. Like an
unknown heartbeat during an ECG. Either benign or
worrisome, an alarm must be triggered.

3. Dynamic Unsupervised Anomaly Detection.Ana
Here some measures change over time till their values are not
normal anymore. For example, while a motor is slowly
deteriorating, one of the measurements might change till it gets
out of control and the motor breaks. We want to stop the motor
before it completely breaks producing even more damages.
This problem is similar to number 2 but slightly more challenging
because it is not pattern based and it changes slowly over time.
